# Daikibo Telemetry Data Analysis: Deloitte Internship - Task One

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Tableau workbook for "Task One" of my Deloitte Internship, focusing on the analysis and visualization of **Daikibo Telemetry Data**.

The primary goal of this task was to explore and visualize sensor readings and operational metrics from Daikibo devices, providing insights into **device status, temperature trends, and operational distribution across various areas and cities**. The visualizations aim to help in understanding device health, identifying patterns, and supporting data-driven decision-making for the Daikibo system.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the `daikibo-telemetry-data.json` dataset. This JSON file contains granular telemetry information, including:

* **`Document ID (generated)`**: Unique identifier for each data record.
* **`Status`**: Indicates the operational status of the device (e.g., 'healthy').
* **`Temperature`**: Numerical temperature readings from the devices.
* **`Device ID`**: Unique identifier for each Daikibo device.
* **`Device Type`**: The type or model of the Daikibo device (e.g., 'MetaPress').
* **`Area`**: The industrial area where the device is located (e.g., 'kehanshin-industrial-zone').
* **`City`**: The city where the device is located (e.g., 'osaka').
* **(Optional: `Timestamp` - if present in your data and used)**: The time at which the telemetry data was recorded.

## Visualizations

The Tableau workbook (`.twbx` file) in this repository includes the following visualizations:

* **[EDIT THIS: Specific Chart Name 1, e.g., "Device Status Distribution"]**: A bar chart displaying **[EDIT THIS: brief description of what it shows, e.g., "the count of devices by their operational status (healthy, unhealthy, etc.), providing an overview of system health"].**
* **[EDIT THIS: Specific Chart Name 2, e.g., "Average Temperature by Device Type/Area"]**: Another bar chart, potentially showing **[EDIT THIS: brief description, e.g., "the average temperature readings across different device types or industrial areas, helping identify thermal patterns"].**

*(**ACTION REQUIRED:** Open your Tableau workbook and identify the exact names of your sheets/dashboards and what each chart explicitly represents. Replace the bracketed placeholders above with accurate details based on what you actually built with this telemetry data.)*

## How to View

To interact with these visualizations:

1.  **Download Tableau Reader or Tableau Desktop:** If you don't have it already, you can download Tableau Public Desktop (free) or Tableau Reader (free, view-only) from the official Tableau website.
2.  **Download the Workbook:** Clone this repository or download the `Task One of Deloitte Internship.twbx` file directly.
3.  **Open in Tableau:** Open the downloaded `.twbx` file using Tableau Reader, Tableau Public Desktop, or Tableau Desktop.

## Technologies Used

* **Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **JSON**: Data format for the raw telemetry data.

## Internship Context

This project was completed as part of the **[EDIT THIS: Your Specific Deloitte Program/Internship Name, e.g., "Deloitte Data Analytics Internship Program"]** during my internship at Deloitte. It demonstrates my ability to **[EDIT THIS: mention specific skills, e.g., "perform data exploration on raw JSON data," "transform telemetry data into meaningful insights," "create compelling data visualizations to monitor system health," "utilize Tableau for business intelligence to analyze IoT/sensor data"].**
